# Hate Speech Detection
This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data using traditional machine learning methods (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF and Word2Vec) and advanced deep learning models (BERT). The goal is to classify text as HATE or NOT HATE while exploring model performance and interpretability.

Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Dynamically Generated Hate Speech Dataset](https://github.com/bvidgen/Dynamically-Generated-Hate-Speech-Dataset), created using a human and model-in-the-loop process. It includes challenging examples to improve robustness and generalizability.
